            At Barnes School, we are committed to instilling a love for
            learning, fostering creativity and empowering our students to meet
            the challenges of a rapidly changing world, by celebrating their
            virtues, accepting their flaws, respecting their values and
            permitting them to grow at their own pace. Our dedicated faculty and
            staff, backed by a combination of intelligence and care, work
            tirelessly to provide a supportive and inclusive environment where
            each young and impressionable student can flourish, knowing that
            only misfits and oddballs change the world and it is cool to be
            different.

          <p>
            We believe in fostering a holistic educational environment that
            nurtures not only academic excellence but also of character
            development and a sense of community. Sports receives special
            emphasis in our school and we take pride in noteworthy achievements
            of our girls’ and boys’ football teams, both having competed at
            national level.

          <p>
            As we approach the milestone of 100 years in January 2024, it fills
            me with immense pride to lead our beloved institution as the first
            lady Principal in a line of distinguished gentlemen, knowing truly
            well that leadership is less about a title or gender, and so much
            more about one’s mindset and devotion to work.
