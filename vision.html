          <p>
            Swatantrya Sainik Raykumar B Gujar Secondary and Higher Secondary Prashala, 
            including its junior college, was founded upon the noble ideals of Maharashtra’s 
            foremost social reformers—Mahatma Jyotiba Phule, Savitribai Phule, Rajarshi Shahu 
            Maharaj, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, Sayajirao Gaikwad, Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil, and
             Maharshi Dhondo Keshav Karve. These leaders were pioneers in advocating for equality 
             through education, envisioning a society where knowledge would be the right of every 
             individual, irrespective of their social or economic background. Their relentless efforts
            helped bring education to the masses, challenging the barriers of caste, gender, and poverty.

            Inspired by their vision, our founders, Sahebrao Shankarrao Dhamdhere (known as Anna) and freedom
           fighter Raikumar Bhogilal Gujar (known as Dadaji), took upon themselves the mission of spreading 
           education in Talegaon Dhamdhere and the neighboring villages. In 1952, they established the Shikshan 
           Prasarak Mandal, a trust dedicated to delivering quality education to underserved communities. 
           With "Tamaso Ma Jyotirgamaya" or "Lead me from darkness to light" as their guiding motto, Anna and Dadaji
            committed their lives to creating a school that would uplift the poorest of the poor, bringing the light of learning to all.

          <h2>  Overcoming Challenges in Early Years</h2>
          <p>
            In its formative years, Shikshan Prasarak Mandal overcame significant obstacles. Shirur, 
            being a drought-prone region with limited educational resources, posed many challenges for a new institution. 
            However, the determination of Anna and Dadaji enabled the school to grow steadily. Early supporters like Colonel
             Sadashivrao Phadnis, who generously offered his land at a low cost, provided the much-needed foundation for the 
             institute’s expansion. As enrollment rose, the original structure could no longer accommodate the number of students.
              Recognizing this need, Shikshan Prasarak Mandal requested more land from the Government of Maharashtra. Chief Minister
               Barrister A. R. Antule, acknowledging their dedication, granted a 9-acre plot, which allowed the institute to expand 
               and better serve the community, aided by the advocacy of Headmaster L.D. Sonawane.

            Following this acquisition, construction began on a new, well-equipped 22-classroom facility. 
            Through the dedication of leaders like Chairman Raikumar Bhogilal Gujar, Secretary Sahebrao Shankarrao Dhamdhere,
             and several other committed individuals, the building was completed and inaugurated by Defense Minister Sharad 
             Chandraji Pawar in 1991. Contributors such as Dattartray Tatyaba Dhamdhere, Sampatrao Bhagwantrao Dhamdhere, Jaykumar 
             Punnchand Runwal, and others made invaluable efforts to bring this vision to life. This achievement symbolized the 
             institute’s commitment to quality education and became a major milestone, creating an environment where students from 
             Talegaon Dhamdhere and surrounding villages could learn in a supportive, resourceful setting.
